# Session 3
This session deals mainly with geospatial data. Documentation and activities are held using QGIS. 
This session extensively explores the RASTER data model and the different data sets that use this format (e.g., Digital Elevation and terrain Models, satellite imagery and aerial photography)

Terrain analysis uses DTM and DEM to perform [standard procedures](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/HTML/index.html?gradient__slope_and_aspect.htm).

Web services are also a relevant data source. Catalunya offers a remarkable set of resources to access [geospatial data](https://www.diba.cat/web/idebarcelona/serveis-de-mapes-wms).

A [Qgis Project](WebServices_Catalunya.qgz) serves as an example for accessing multiple data sets for Catalunya trough web services.
